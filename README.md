The thesis is available at [http://davidstutz.de/projects/superpixelsseeds/](http://davidstutz.de/projects/superpixelsseeds/) as well as on GitHub: [davdstutz/bachelor-thesis-superpixels](https://github.com/davidstutz/bachelor-thesis-superpixels).

This repository contains the corresponding evaluation results in `data/` which have been obtained using an extended version of the Berkeley Segmentation Benchmark [3], available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/davidstutz/extended-berkeley-segmentation-benchmark).
